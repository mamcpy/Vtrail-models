# Vtrail-models

This repository contains the models I developed for the Vtrail project as part of the VMware Barcelona Hackathon of 2023. 
Below is brief description of my team project.

Vtrail is a web API that scrapes social media platforms including Twitter, Reddit, and Stack Overflow for posts. It classifies these posts by sentiment and category using an in-house machine learning model. The application consists of APIs written in Node.js and Python, as well as a user interface built with Angular. The ultimate goal of the project is to filter social media posts based on specific criteria such as sentiment, category, or any other helpful factor. This will enable users to narrow down their search results from the live searches instead of having to do it manually, which could be a time-consuming task.

The main repository for Vtrail is:
